# Intro To Design Patterns

## What's a Design Pattern

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in
software design.

The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving
a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a
solution that suits the realties of your own program.

### What does the pattern consist of?

- Intent: of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- Motivation: further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes
  possible.
- Structure: of classes show each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- Code examples: in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to
  grasp the idea behind the pattern.

### Classification of patterns

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called _idioms_. They usually
apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are _architectural patterns_.
Developers can implement these patterns in many languages. Unlike other
patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of entire applications.

Patterns can be categorized by their intent or purpose:

#### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase
flexibility and reuse of existing code.

#### Structural Patterns

Structural Patterns explain how to assemble objects and class into larger
structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

#### Behavioral Patterns

Behavior patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
